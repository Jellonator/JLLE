# JLLE
Jello's Love2D Lua Engine

This mess of code is an engine I use for making games with Lua.

### Features
- Entity systems
- World management
- A few helper functions
- A simplistic collision system
- A few graphics things
- Tiled level loading(csv only)
- Lotsa spaghetti

### TODO
- Grid <-> Grid collision
- Better collision resoultion (Ha! like that will ever happen)
- Particle system
- Support more Tiled features(polygons/polylines, maybe some of the other things)

### Credits
- Jellonator
- Code copied off Stackoverflow I already forgot about

### Changelog
##### V 1.0.0
- Initial release
- Decided to use github because I probably should learn this crap eventually
