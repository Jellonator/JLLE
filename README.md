# JLLE
Jello's Love2D Lua Engine

This mess of code is an engine I use for making games with Lua.

Note that this is NOT a replacement for Love2D, it is meant to augment Love2D. In using this engine, it is still necessary to use Love2D. JLLE is only to make more complex things a little easier to manage, such as entity management, collision, and spritemaps.

Also note that for the most part this is my own engine that I use for my own stuff, and as of such it's mostly built for my own personal use. Doesn't mean I don't appreciate commits, and you can also use it for whatever you want I don't care.

### Features
- Entity systems
- World management
- A few helper functions
- A simplistic collision system
- A few graphics things
- Tiled level loading(csv only)
- Lotsa spaghetti

### TODO
- Grid <-> Grid collision
- Better collision resoultion (Ha! like that will ever happen)
- Particle system
- Support more Tiled features(polygons/polylines, maybe some of the other things)

### Credits
- Jellonator

### Changelog
##### V 1.0.0

- Decided to use github because I probably should learn this crap eventually
